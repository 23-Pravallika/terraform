## Terrafile:

```
        1)Terrafile is a binary written in Go to systematically manage external modules from Github for use in Terraform
        2)The combination of a mix of concerns with the module source and implementation with a potentially laborious and error prone   module upgrade process resulted in the creation of a Terrafile to address these issues.
